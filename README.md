# Unmasking_deceptive_links
The Internet has become an indispensable part of our life, However, It also has provided opportunities to anonymously perform malicious activities like Phishing.Unmasking deceptive links is a technique for detecting bogus links and URLs. Using powerful Machine Learning algorithms raises worries concerning the users' data, such as  account ID, username,  email addresses and passwords. Using this strategy, the user is rescued from typing their credentials, which helps in protecting their sensitive data from cyberattacks. There are numerous Machine Learning algorithms, however they tend to lag in recognizing a spam link. However, employing classifier such as Gradient boosting classifiers provide efficient accuracy during the training and testing phases. Experimental evaluation is carried out using a benchmark dataset, and the findings are compared to several other classification techniques for efficient validation.
